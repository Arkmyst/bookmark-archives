# web-link-bookmarks

**The Intent** - is to store all my bookmarks online that I find interesting in simple laid-out list format.

**Important** - as for links that I need to remember to come back to, they will have this :star: next to it.

## Contents - This needs some extreme structuring (that I will get to when I'm not lazy...)

- cs-general
- cs-courses
- cybersecurity
- tutorials
- neovim
- emacs
- programming languages
- machine-learning
- career-and-student-resources
